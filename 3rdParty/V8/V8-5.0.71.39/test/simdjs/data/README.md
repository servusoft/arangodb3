# ecmascript_simd
===============

This repository contains:
*  The authoritative API reference documentation is generated from tc39/spec.html. You can view a rendered copy at http://tc39.github.io/ecmascript_simd/ .
*  A polyfill at src/ecmascript_simd.js, which can't implement value semantics, but includes a correct implementation of all functions
*  Extensive tests at src/ecmascript_simd_tests.js, which can be run using other files in src/. Benchmarks and example code live in the same directory.
*  A presentation explaining the motivation and outlining the approach at [tc39/SIMD-128 TC-39.pdf](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_simd/blob/master/tc39/SIMD-128%20TC-39.pdf)
