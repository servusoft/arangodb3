Conventions for testing framework:
==================================

All files in this directory whose name starts with "api-"
and ends with ".js" automatically take part in http
or https server tests, with the exception of 
"api-replication-spec.js".

If the filename contains the string "-cluster-", then it is
only executed when testing in cluster mode. If the filename
contains the string "-noncluster-", then it is only executed
when testing in single instance mode.
